that both computers will upload into the same cloud folder Second ensure that you have the same cloud credentials security keys and the bucket in the Account Settings Third ensure that you have the same backup prefix on both machines by going to Edit Accounts Select your account and click Edit Then click Advanced settings Enter any prefix you want just keep in mind that you have to enter the same prefix on both machines to have smooth and successful backups Now you need to copy your large files onto an external hard drive In our example a folder named Docs was copied from the slow PC onto a USB flash drive This folder contains all the large files that would take forever to upload on the slow PC Now open CloudBerry Backup on the fast PC and enter your Amazon credentials security keys
